# Rubber Boots
### A production of Blue Cliff Games

## Conventions
- Each new build will be pushed on its own branch (i.e. test-build-1, test-build-2, test-build-3, etc.)
- Never push directly to master, only merge from another branch into master
- After a branch has been merged to another branch, delete that branch (i.e. branch-1 merged to branch-2, delete branch-1)
- master will contain the definitive version of the game - the most recent tested and approved build
